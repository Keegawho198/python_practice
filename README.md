Student Depression Analysis | Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- Conducted exploratory and statistical analysis on student mental health data (15K+ rows)
- Identified key factors (e.g., academic pressure, sleep duration) correlated with depression
- Applied T-tests and Mann-Whitney U tests to compare depressed vs. non-depressed groups
- Built a logistic regression model achieving XX% accuracy in predicting depression status
- Visualized insights using boxplots, heatmaps, and categorical breakdowns (gender, financial stress)
